MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key regulators in cellular processes, and several studies have indicated their potential role in IBD development and progression. These non-coding RNA molecules regulate gene expression, the immune system, and gut microbiota interactions. This review discusses the role of miRNAs in IBD pathogenesis, focusing on their regulatory functions in mucosal immunity and gut microorganisms. Additionally, the article highlights the potential of miRNAs as biomarkers for IBD diagnosis, along with their therapeutic implications.\"",

Compared with light drinkers, moderate and heavy drinkers had a significantly higher dementia risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.29 and 1.77, respectively). In stratified analyses by sex, both moderate and heavy drinking were associated with an increased dementia risk in men (HR 1.47 and 1.86, respectively) while the association remained for heavy drinking in women (HR 1.99).

Baseline and follow-up assessments included HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and inflammatory markers. After the six-month intervention, patients in the vitamin D group had a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c levels compared to the placebo group.

Two researchers involved in the study decide to measure blood glucose concentration and lipid profile postprandially (i.e. after a meal), as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Their study group consists of 16 women over 50 years of age who live in the neighborhood in a small town where the clinic is located. The women are given the supplement in the form of a pill, which they take during a high-fat meal or 15 minutes prior to eating. Their results indicate that the supplement can reduce the postprandial glycemic and lipid response, as well as lower blood pressure. Based on their conclusions, the researchers decided to put the product on the market and to conduct a nation-wide marketing campaign.

However, data collected on Speedtest.net is not anonymous as follows: Ookla collects users' IP Addresses, and network, hardware and device identifiers as described in the above section. Ookla may also use publicly-available data collected through the Web Speed feature of the Speedtest extension on your web browser to ascertain your approximate location (if your browser settings allow it). Ookla licenses the Online Data collected on Speedtest.net, the Speedtest App and/or the Speedtest browser extension to various companies around the world, including IP addresses (collected on Speedtest.net, the Speedtest App and/or the Speedtest feature of the browser extension only, but not through the Web Speed feature of the extension), and network, hardware and device identifiers and speed results from the tests you take. In most cases, the IP addresses collected when you run a test on Speedtest.net, the Speedtest App, or through the Speedtest feature of the browser extension are masked or partially hidden, but in some cases we provide the full IP address to the company licensing the information. For some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and mobile carriers, Ookla will provide full IP addresses, as well as and network, hardware and device identifiers, for that company's customers upon request for use in customer insights and assistance. Ookla may also provide full IP addresses, as well as and network, hardware and device identifiers, to equipment manufacturers and core network, or wholesale, providers on a case-by-case basis for network research purposes. In the cases in which we provide the full IP address, and network, hardware and device identifiers, it is because the company, typically an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or mobile carrier, owns those IP addresses, and network, hardware and device identifiers and provides them to their customers when their customers enter into a service contract. Because the company owns the IP address, and network, hardware and device identifiers, we provide that full information to those companies when they specifically request that information.

In most cases, the IP addresses collected when you run a test on Speedtest.net, the Speedtest App, or through the Speedtest feature of the browser extension are masked or partially hidden, but in some cases we provide the full IP address to the company licensing the information.

On July\n7, 2014 Warren announced that it had agreed to buy a position in the hydraulic fracturing\nMarcellus Shale gas region in northeastern Pennsylvania from Citrus for $352.5 million,\nconsisting of $312.5 million in cash and $40 million in Warren common stock, with a valuation\nof $6 per share. Peterson, a co-founder of Citrus and its President and CEO, also joined\nWarren\u2019 s board of directors. The deal was effective, for economic purposes, as of July 1, 2014.\n9. The Citrus acquisition was a transformative deal for Warren, as it doubled the\nCompany\u2019 s reserves and tripled production. However, the acquisition would also greatly\nincrease the Company\u2019 s sensitivity to market fluctuations for natural gas, and Warren\u2019 s debt\nwould dramatically increase, as the Company funded the cash portion of the Citrus purchase byCase 1:16-cv-02037-CBS   Document 1   Filed 08/11/16   \nOnly answer with the company defendants names.",

These promissory notes \nprovided that the noteholders would receiv e bonus payments based on the average price \nof the company's stock in its first 20 days of public trading.  (McShane Decl., \u00b6 5). \nUpon being publicly listed, the stock pri ce of Dakota Plains almost immediately \nrose to $12 per share on very light volume and stayed at or near $12 per share for almost \nexactly 20 days.  The price then declined gra dually until September 24, 2012.  Since \nSeptember 24, 2012, Dakota Plains has neve r traded above $4.24, and it is currently \ntrading under $1.  As a result of the stock price during the initial 20-day period, Dakota \nPlains disclosed that the noteholders were en titled to receive payments of approximately \n$32.9 million.

In approving the Proposed Transaction,  the Individual Defendants have breached \ntheir fiduciary duties of loyalty, good faith, due care and disclosure by, inter alia , (i) agreeing to \nsell Cleveland BioLabs without  first taking steps to ensure that Plaintiff in his capacity as a \nCompany public stockholder would obtain adequate, fair and maximum consideration under the \ncircumstances; and (ii) engineering the Proposed Transaction  to benefit themselves and/or \nCytocom  without regard for Cleveland BioLabs\u2019  public stockholders .  Accordingly, this action \nseeks to enjoin the Proposed Transaction  and compel the Individual Defendants to properly \nexercise their fiduciary duties to Plaintiff and other Cleveland BioLabs  stockhold ers. Case 1:21-cv-02187   Document 1   Filed 03/12/21   Page 3 of 29 \n 4 8. Next, it appears as though the Board has entered into the Proposed Transaction to \nprocure for itself  and senior management of the Company significant and immediate benefits with \nno thought to Plaintiff, as well as the Company\u2019s public stockholders.  F or instance, pursuant to \nthe terms of the Merger Agreement, upon the consummation of the Proposed Transaction, \nCompany Board Members and executive officers will be able to exchange all Company equity \nawards for the merger consideration.  \n9. In violation of their fiduciary duties , Defendants caused to be filed the materially \ndeficient Registration Statement on February 16, 2021 with the SEC in an effort to Plaintiff,  to \nvote in favor of the Proposed Transaction .  The  Registration Statement is materially deficient, \ndeprives Plaintiff  of the information necessary  to make an intelligent, informed and rational \ndecision of whether to vote in favor of the Proposed Transaction, and is thus in breach of \nDefendants fiduciary d uties .  As detailed below, the Registration Statement  omits and/or \nmisrepresents material information concerning, among other things: (a) the sales process and in\nOnly answer with the company defendants names.",

Defendant ADT is an electronic security system company incorporated under the laws of Delaware.  ADT\u2019s history traces back to the American District Telegraph Company, formed in 1874 as a consortium of 57 telegraph operators.  After over a century in business and a series of acquisitions and mergers, ADT became a public company in September 2012.  Throughout its prior tenure as a public company, ADT characterized its business as a recurring revenue business, where approximately 90% of its revenue is generated from its multi-year customer contracts, and emphasized five key value drivers for its subscription-based business model: customer additions, costs to add a new customer (known as subscriber acquisition costs or \u201cSAC\u201d), average revenue per customer, costs incurred to provide service to customers, and customer tenure.  In May 2016, Defendant Apollo Global, a private equity firm, acquired ADT in a leveraged buyout, after which ADT became a privately owned company and thus ceased trading publicly.  Through the IPO, ADT was spun off by Apollo Global and again became a public corporation, trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \u201cADT.\u201d   21. Defendant Apollo Global is the private equity firm that took ADT private in a leveraged buyout in May 2016 and then quickly took ADT public again via the January 2018 IPO.  Apollo Global exercises control over ADT, its officers, and its board of directors.  Apollo Global appointed a majority of ADT\u2019s board of directors and, through affiliated funds, continues to own a majority of the voting power of ADT\u2019s outstanding common stock. As a result, ADT is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d \u2013 i.e., controlled by Apollo Global - under the corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies and for purposes of the federal securities laws.

After over a century in business and a series of acquisitions and mergers, ADT became a public company in September 2012.  Throughout its prior tenure as a public company, ADT characterized its business as a recurring revenue business, where approximately 90% of its revenue is generated from its multi-year customer contracts, and emphasized five key value drivers for its subscription-based business model: customer additions, costs to add a new customer (known as subscriber acquisition costs or \u201cSAC\u201d), average revenue per customer, costs incurred to provide service to customers, and customer tenure.  In May 2016, Defendant Apollo Global, a private equity firm, acquired ADT in a leveraged buyout, after which ADT became a privately owned company and thus ceased trading publicly.

This decision is based in part on our review of the work by a third\n-\nparty \nengineering firm to identify necessary capital improveme\nnts. While we believe that \nthe issues we have been experiencing at the facility can be resolved with additional \ncapital investments, we have concluded that it is not economical to pursue those \ninvestments or to continue to operate the facility at this time\n. Rentech\u2019s other \nbusinesses, including its Atikokan facility, continue to operate without interruption.\n \n \nAs a result of this decision, the Wawa operations team will immediately begin a \nsafe and orderly idling of the facility, which the Company expects to \ncomplete in Case 2:17-cv-00997   Document 1   Filed 02/22/17   Page 8 of 17 PageID #: 89\n \napproximately two weeks. When the facility is successfully idled, a small \nworkforce will remain in place to maintain the plant so that it can resume operations \nwith minimal cost and time if there is interest from a third party to invest in or \np\nurchase the facility. The remainder of the workforce will be placed on a temporary \nlayoff while options for the facility are explored.\n \n \nRentech expects to incur a significant asset impairment charge relating to the Wawa \nand Atikokan facilities in its fourt\nh quarter 2016 results.\n \n \n*\n \n*\n \n*\n \n \nStrategic Alternatives Review Process\n \n \nRentech intends to explore strategic alternatives for the Wawa facility and for \nthe Company as a who\nOnly answer with the company defendants names.",

Having agreed to sell the Company, the Individual Defendants then had to convince \nstockholders to vote to approve it.  That task was not necessarily going to be easy, g iven that \nanother party had offered to buy the Company for $22.50 per share, that AMRI shares had \npreviously traded as high as $23.95 per share, and that the Company was on course for significant \ngrowth and profits.  Thus, in order to make the Merger price  appear attractive to AMRI\u2019s outside \nstockholders, the defendants issued a proxy statement recommending approval of the Merger (the \n\u201cProxy Statement\u201d) that contained materially false and misleading information and omitted other \nmaterial information that wa s necessary to make the information that was disclosed not misleading.  \n5.

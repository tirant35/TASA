This study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes, including mortality and length of hospital stay, of using hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients.\nMethods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, involving 156 COVID-19 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and 443 patients not treated with hydroxychloroquine. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were the length of hospital stay and the length of intensive care unit stay.\nResults: The mortality rate was significantly higher among patients treated with hydroxychloroquine (46.2%) than those not treated with hydroxychloroquine (37.7%; P = 0.04). In multivariate analysis, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was significantly associated with a higher risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.37-3.25; P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay or length of intensive care unit stay between the two groups.\nConclusions: Hydroxychloroquine use was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. The drug did not show any benefit with respect to the length of hospital stay or length of intensive care unit stay. Its clinical use in treating COVID-19 should be carefully reassessed.",

This study aimed to assess the efficacy of silymarin in combination with cisplatin, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, on the growth of human lung cancer cells both in vitro and in a murine xenograft model. Our results demonstrated that silymarin increased the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin on lung cancer cells, and the combination treatment significantly reduced tumor volume in the murine model. Additionally, the co-treatment of silymarin and cisplatin induced apoptosis in cancer cells through the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins. These findings suggest that silymarin could be a novel adjuvant for cisplatin chemotherapy, enhancing its anti-cancer efficacy and reducing potential drug resistance.\"",

They calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for colorectal cancer incidence according to quintiles of magnesium intake using Cox proportional hazards models.\nResults: A total of 85,903 participants were followed up for a median of 17.5 years, during which 2,083 cases of colorectal cancer were identified. The highest quintile of magnesium intake was significantly inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk in women (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.68\u20130.93), but not in men (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.87\u20131.12).

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Diet is an important environmental factor that modulates gene expression, which in turn can influence the balance of lipid and bile acid (BA) homeostasis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of diets enriched in different fats (butter, olive oil, and sunflower oil) on gene expression in the liver and small intestine. METHODS: Thirty-two male rats were divided into four groups (n=8/group). Each group was fed a control diet or a diet enriched in 15% (w/w) of butter, olive oil, or sunflower oil for ten weeks. Liver and small intestine samples were collected and total RNA was isolated. Gene expression changes were analyzed using qPCR for 18 genes involved in lipid and BA metabolism. RESULTS: Diet had a strong effect on gene expression in the small intestine and liver. Some genes were up-regulated by butter compared to the control group, while olive oil and sunflower oil down-regulated or had an intermediate effect. Gene expression changes correlated with changes in plasma lipid and BA levels. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that diets enriched in different fats can markedly influence lipid and BA homeostasis by modulating gene expression in the liver and small intestine.",

Methods: We infected Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 and treated them with different concentrations of remdesivir for time-course experiments. We measured viral RNA levels by quantitative RT-PCR and assessed cell viability by ATP assays. Results: Remdesivir demonstrated a potent antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 in a concentration and time-dependent manner, which was associated with reduced viral RNA levels and improved cell viability in infected Vero E6 cells.

A comprehensive literature search was performed from MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for randomized controlled trials comparing aspirin to placebo. Pooled relative risks, risk difference, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for stroke, myocardial infarction, and bleeding events. A total of 13 trials with 164,225 participants were included. In the aspirin group, 7108 (8.65%) participants had a stroke compared to 7301 (8.84%) in the placebo group (relative risk 0.98, 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.01). Myocardial infarction occurred in 4922 (5.97%) participants in the aspirin group and 5365 (6.5%) in the placebo group (relative risk 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88 to 0.96). Bleeding events were significantly higher in the aspirin group, with 8639 (10.49%) compared to 6827 (8.39%) in the placebo group (relative risk 1.25, 95% CI: 1.21 to 1.30).

METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted, involving 150 patients. Participants were randomized to receive either 25 mg/day CBD, 50 mg/day CBD, or a placebo. Pain intensity, quality of life, and safety were assessed at baseline and every two weeks for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Both the 25 mg/day and 50 mg/day CBD groups demonstrated a significant reduction in pain intensity compared to the placebo group. Additionally, the 50 mg/day CBD group showed the most significant improvement in quality of life. No serious adverse events were reported.

The primary outcome was a reduction in hepatitis B virus DNA levels, and the secondary outcomes included normalization of alanine aminotransferase levels and improvement in liver histology.\n\nResults: After 48 weeks, a significantly higher proportion of patients receiving XZ123 achieved a reduction in hepatitis B virus DNA levels compared with the placebo group (71% vs 20%, P<0.001). XZ123 also showed significant improvement in secondary outcomes such as normalization of alanine aminotransferase levels and liver histology. The safety profile of XZ123 was similar to the placebo group, with no treatment-related serious adverse events reported.\n\nConclusions: The novel antiviral drug XZ123 demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing hepatitis B virus DNA levels and showed significant improvement in secondary outcomes compared to placebo, with a similar safety profile.

Smith, John P. Green, and James R. Taylor\nJournal: Journal of Geriatric Cardiology\n\nAbstract: Objective: To determine the long-term effect of habitual physical activity on reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in middle-aged and older adults. Methods: A total of 454 participants aged 50-79 years, free of CVD at baseline, were recruited from a local community and followed for a median of 5 years. Habitual physical activity was assessed using a questionnaire at baseline and follow-up visits. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the association between physical activity and CVD risk reduction. Results: Over the follow-up period, 38 participants developed CVD events. The age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for developing CVD in participants with moderate to vigorous physical activity compared to those who were inactive was 0.48, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.26-0.87. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, participants who were physically active had a 46% lower risk of CVD events (HR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.27-0.99). This protective effect remained significant after multivariable adjustment (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.29-1.02). Conclusion: Habitual physical activity is independently associated with a substantial reduction in CVD risk among middle-aged and older adults. Our findings emphasize the importance of promoting physical activity for CVD prevention in these populations.",

A total of 1,212 incident CRC patients and 1,322 healthy controls were included in the study. The results revealed significant associations between genetic polymorphisms in CYP1A1 and GSTP1 and CRC risk, after adjusting for age, body mass index, and smoking. Individuals carrying the CYP1A1*2A/*2A genotype showed a 1.63-fold increased risk of CRC, while those with the GSTP1*2/*2 genotype showed a 2.08-fold increased CRC risk compared to their respective wild-type genotype carriers. No significant associations were found for the other CYP1A2, GSTM1, and GSTT1 genes.

Gut microbiota composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and clinical markers were measured. The high-fiber diet significantly increased gut microbiota richness and diversity and was correlated with reduced fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels. Furthermore, short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria were more abundant in participants following the high-fiber diet. Our results suggest that a high-fiber diet promotes beneficial changes in gut microbiota composition and may improve metabolic control in type 2 diabetes patients.",
